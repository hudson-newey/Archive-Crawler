# Archive Crawler
Archive.org Crawler was developed with the intent to create an open internet! 
  
## How it works

The [https://archive.org/](Archive.org) Crawler works through volunteering users who install an extension on their browsers. When the user visits a webpage, the URL is anonymously added to the [https://archive.org/](Archive.org) database.  

If the website is already pending to be pushed to the Archive database, it will not be added to the pending webpages list.  

This list can be manually pushed to the database, e.g. every week, get all the sites which users of the internet use and archive the sites. This is a safeguard not to overload the Archive.org database with re-entries of the same website in a short amount of time.

> Archive.org Crawler was created to develop a free and open internet  
> With mass adaptation of [https://archive.org/](Archive.org) Crawler, [https://archive.org/](archive.org) will be able to easily archive the entire internet for free!    
> Admins can choose when to push their additions to the [https://archive.org/](Archive.org) database,  
> DO NOT AUTOMATICALLY PUSH as i guess this would overload the servers really fast (we don't need to index google every day)
   
## **IMPORTANT NOTICES**

* **I DOES NOT HAVE ANY AFFILIATION TO ARCHIVE.ORG**
* Users will be required to opt into their anonymous additions to the [https://archive.org/](Archive.org) Crawler
* I just genuinely thought this would be an inexpensive way to archive and the entire web
